        <article><p>My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/femi-adeyemi-30832056/" target="_blank">Femi Adeyemi</a></a>. I graduated from LAUTECH few years ago with 2nd Class Upper Division (BTech, Microbiology). I actually wanted to study medicine but then, it didn't work out, LOL.</p>
            <p>I started my tech journey before I even gained admission into the university but nothing serious or professional. But when I graduated, I began my professional IT journey with Oracle Database administration. I was certified as Oracle Database Associate, and then Oracle Database Professioanl, both 11g and 12c versions. 
                And then I went on to be certified as AWS Solution Architect. I also have OS (Operating systems (Linux)) experiences</p>
                <p>My Altschool journey started because I wanted more. I wanted to be a Software Developer. I've been doing self-study but it wasn't working. I knew I needed to be taught by professionals and Altschool provided that opportunity. I'm here to be equiped as a backend developer (but it's actually a fullstack because frontend was taught in the first semester!)
                    I also have the vision of spreading the gospel of tech in Africa, and the world at large.
                </p><p>Watch out for me in this tech space! And, thank you Altschool Africa for this golden opportunity. I can't speak for others, but you will be proud of me in the future that I was once a student that passed through your school. </p>
